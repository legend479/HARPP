# Version Control Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for effective version control management within our project.

## Version Control System
We will use Git as our version control system for this project.

## Branching Strategy
We will follow the Gitflow branching strategy, which consists of the following branches:
- `master`: Represents the production-ready code.
- `testing`: Represents the code that is being tested before deployment.
- `feature`: Represents the code for new features being developed.

## Commit Guidelines
- Each commit should have a clear and descriptive message that explains the changes made.
- Commits should be small and focused, addressing a single issue or feature.
- Avoid committing large binary files or generated artifacts.

## Pull Request Process
- All changes should be made through pull requests.
- Pull requests should include a clear description of the changes made.
- Code reviews should be conducted by at least one team member before merging.

## Release Process
- Releases should be tagged with a version number following semantic versioning guidelines.
- Only stable and tested code should be released.

## Documentation
- All code changes should be documented in the project's documentation files.
- Documentation should be kept up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Backup and Recovery
- Regular backups of the repository should be performed to prevent data loss.
- A disaster recovery plan should be in place to handle any unforeseen issues.
